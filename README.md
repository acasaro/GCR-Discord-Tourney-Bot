## Run

Runs the bot locally. This technically puts the bot online connected to the GCR test server.

```sh
npm start
```

## Deploy

Deletes and re-deploys slash commands. Sometimes required but don't use for basic changes. Simply just stop and restart server locally to refresh bot on test Discord.

```sh
npm start
```
